# isGraphicalScript
### Description
A simple algorithm written in Python to determine if a given degree sequence is graphical.
This was a fun and easy project to easily and quickly check if a given degree sequence is graphical. This script was used to solve several problems from:  
[*A First Course in Graph Theory*](http://smile.amazon.com/First-Course-Graph-Theory-Mathematics/dp/0486483681/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458357490&sr=8-1&keywords=graph+theory+first+course "Amazon") by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang.
  
These problems are in the comments of the main function with the number of the book problem listed.
  
### How to Use:
This is a command line script. Simply go where this file is saved and type in  
``$ isGraphical.py [arguments] ``  
This script takes in space separated arguments.
  
If you wish to see the degree sequence at each stage of the algorithm, you may use the ``-v`` verbose flag.  
``$ isGraphical.py [arguments] -v``  
The ``-v`` flag can appear interweaved in the arguments if so desired.
